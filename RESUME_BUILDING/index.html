        <p><b>1. Keep it to One Page</b><br><br>
            This is a biggie! If a hiring manager’s spending six seconds looking at your resume, he or she might <br> not even get to the second page! Unless you’re applying to be an executive or a partner somewhere, <br> one page will be sufficient and is a widely accepted “best practice.” To cut it down, remember the <br> purpose of it—it’s not to showcase everything you’ve ever done, but rather to show that you have <br> the background, skills, and experience for the job at hand. <br><br>
            
            <b>2. Avoid Spelling or Grammar Errors</b><br><br>
            Another biggie. There are some recruiters who will discount your resume the second they see a  <br>spelling or grammar error. Although it can be painful, make sure you don’t just read over your  <br>resume several times, but also that you have a friend take a peek, too. <br><br>
            
            <b>3. Watch Your Tenses</b><br><br>
            This is another common error that can really hurt you in the eyes of hiring managers. As a general <br>rule, if something on your resume is in the past, use the past tense (managed, delivered, organized) <br>and if you are still actively in the role, use the present tense (manage, deliver, organize). <br><br>
            
            <b>4. Avoid the First Person Pronouns</b><br><br>
            As a general practice, don’t use words like “I” or “me” or “my.” So, instead of saying “I hit and <br>exceeded company sales quotas 100% of the time” say “Hit and exceeded sales quotas 100% of the time.” <br><br>
            
            <b>5. Send Your Resume as a PDF</b><br><br>
            Saving your resume as a PDF (rather than a Word and document) freezes it as an image so that you <br> can be sure hiring managers see the same formatting as you. If you send it any other way, there’s a <br>chance that the styling, format, font, and so on, could look different on their computer than yours. <br><br>
            
            <b>6. Label Your Resume File Correctly</b><br><br>
            Too many people save this important document with random or generic file names like sgks123.pdf <br> or resume.pdf. Remember that recruiters can see the name of the file that you send them and also <br> remember that they get tons of resumes every day. Make it super clear whose resume they should <br>click on by saving it under a logical name like FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf. <br><br>
            
            <b>7. Format in a Logical Structure</b><br><br>
            Even more important than naming the file in a logical manner is laying out your resume in a logical <br> manner. How you lay it out really depends on where you are in your career path and what you’re <br>looking to do next. While chronological the default, it’s not always the best way to make your case. <br> Muse writer Lily Zhang lays out the other options that might work better for you. <br><br>
            
            <b>8. Make Sure It’s Easy to Read</b><br><br>
            You might be tempted to just shrink the text to get your resume to fit on a page. (Which is funny, <br> because remember all those times in school when you made it 12.5 to make it longer? Life!) While <br> you can adjust the size to some degree, never go below 10-point font. <br><br>
            
            <b>9. Keep it Organized and Visually Appealing</b><br><br>
            Remember how hiring managers usually spend just six seconds looking at your resume? Help them <br> maximize that time by making your resume super clear and easy-to-read. You want each section <br>bolded (maybe capitalized) and each job title bolded. Make your life easier by using a template. <br><br>
            
            <b>10. Keep it Consistent</b><br><br>
            Just like you want your verb tenses to be consistent throughout, it’s also important that the <br>formatting is, too. If one title’s bold, the other titles should be bold. If one bullet point has a period <br> at the end, the other bullet points should have that as well. <br><br>
